    <h1>What Is Memory?</h1>
    <p>
      Memory refers to the psychological processes of acquiring, storing,
      retaining, and later retrieving information. There are three major
      processes involved in memory: encoding, storage, and retrieval. Human
      memory involves the ability to both preserve and recover information.
      However, this is not a flawless process. Sometimes people forget or
      misremember things. Other times, information is not properly encoded in
      memory in the first place.
    </p>
    <h1>How Memories Are Formed</h1>
    <p>
      In order to create a new memory, information must be changed into a usable
      form, which occurs through a process known as encoding. Once the
      information has been successfully encoded, it must be stored in memory for
      later use. Researchers have long believed that memories form due to
      changes in brain neurons (nerve cells). Our understanding today is that
      memories are created through the connections that exist between these
      neurons—either by strengthening these connections or through the growth of
      new connections.

    <h1>How Long Do Memories Last?</h1>
    <p>
      You can't discuss what memory is without also talking about how long
      memories last. Some memories are very brief, just seconds long, and allow
      people to take in sensory information about the world. Short-term memories
      are a bit longer and last about 20 to 30 seconds. These memories mostly
      consist of the information people are currently focusing on and thinking
      about. Some memories are capable of enduring much longer—lasting days,
      weeks, months, or even decades. Most of these long-term memories lie
      outside of immediate awareness but can be drawn into consciousness when
      needed.

    <h1>Why Do We Remember Painful Memories?</h1>
    <p>
      Have you ever noticed that many times, painful memories tend to hang on
      for long periods of time? Research suggests that this is because of
      increased biological arousal during the negative experience, which
      increases the longevity of that memory.
